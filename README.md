A text-based Role-Playing Game (RPG) built with Python, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project demonstrates how to manage game states, character statistics, and turn-based combat logic.

Key Features
1. Object-Oriented Design: Utilizes classes for Character and Monster to manage attributes and behaviors independently.
2. Dynamic Combat System: Features a turn-based battle system with randomized damage calculation for a more unpredictable experience.
3. Progression & Leveling: Implements an experience point (EXP) system where the player strengthens (HP and Attack Power increase) upon leveling up.
4. Random Encounters: A variety of monsters (Slime, Goblin, Oak, Dragon) appear randomly, each with unique stats and rewards.

Technical Stack
1. Language: Python 3.14
2. Libraries: random (Standard Library)
